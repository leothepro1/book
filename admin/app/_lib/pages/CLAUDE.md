# Pages, TenantConfig & visual editor

This module owns page identity, tenant configuration shape, and editor wiring.
Loaded automatically when Claude works in `app/_lib/pages/` or related editor code.

## TenantConfig — v2 shape

TenantConfig is stored as JSON in Prisma `Tenant.settings`.

Per-page data:
  config.pages[pageId].sections     ← section instances
  config.pages[pageId].layoutId     ← active layout variant
  config.pages[pageId].enabled      ← page active state

Global (shared across all pages):
  config.globalHeader               ← one HeaderConfig, all pages share it
  config.globalFooter               ← one FooterConfig, all pages share it
  config.colorSchemes               ← global color scheme definitions

Legacy v1 shape (config.home.*) is migrated automatically on load
via migrateToV2Pages() — idempotent, runs on every getTenantConfig() call.

**config.ts is the ONLY file that reads or writes config paths.**
Never access config.pages[x] or config.globalHeader directly outside config.ts.
All reads and writes go through typed accessor functions.

## Page registry

PAGE_REGISTRY is the single source of truth for all page logic.

Each PageDefinition:
  id: PageId (string literal union — not plain string)
  slug, availableLayouts, defaultLayout
  editorVisible: boolean
  header: boolean
  body: "sections" | "fixed"
  footer: boolean
  requiresFeatureFlag?: string

Current pages: home, stays, account, check-in, help-center, support

Tenants cannot create or delete pages.
Tenants can switch layouts on editorVisible pages.
No page IDs are hardcoded in shared code — always reference PAGE_REGISTRY.

---

## Visual editor structure

Left panel (sp-list):
  Sidhuvud — header singleton
  Mall — section builder
  Sidfot — footer singleton

Canvas: live booking engine preview
Right panel: DetailPanel — configuration panels

Edit pipeline:
  pushUndo(snapshot) → updateConfig() → saveDraft()

Undo snapshots are page-scoped to prevent multi-tab overwrite.
PreviewContext.config is the single source of truth for editor state.

---

## Header and footer

Both are global singletons stored in config.globalHeader / config.globalFooter.
NOT per-page. NOT sections. No blocks or elements.
Editing header/footer on any page updates it everywhere.
Each has a dedicated editor panel.

## Invariants — never violate

1. config.ts is the only file that knows config paths
2. PAGE_REGISTRY is the only source of truth for page logic
3. Header/footer are global singletons — never per-page
4. Tenants cannot create pages, layouts, or locked sections
5. Editor mirrors real rendering rules exactly
6. No page IDs hardcoded in shared code — always reference PAGE_REGISTRY
